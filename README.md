# GymPass Style API

This is a repository of a Gympass API, using NodeJs to build a RESTful API. 

Technologies used in this project are:
- Typescript (Programming Language)
- Fastify (Server Instance Framework)
- Zod (Validate Variables)
- BiomeJs (Formatter)
- Prisma (ORM)
- Docker
- Vitest (Unit Test)
- JWT (Authentication)

As the project grows, I'll update the readme file with more technologies and functionalities explained step-by-step.
